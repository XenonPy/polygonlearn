# How Levels work in Polygon Learn
>By XenonPy

As you work your way through lessons, you'll notice that you gain XP. So what does it do? XP simply tracks how much work you do on Polygon Learn. When you start out, you'll unlock a new icon, or Poly, every 10 XP. But starting at level 5, it takes one more XP to level up. For example, it takes 11 XP to get from level 4 to level 5, and 12 XP to get from level 5 to level 6. 
### Why does it work this way?
Put simply, we wanted to present more of a challenge to give more exclusive rewards to more long-time users, and this system gives that a nice difficulty curve.
### What Poly will I get at (insert level) level?
You'll unlock a new shape for your Poly every four stages. In between stages your Poly will grow before resetting its size when you unlock a new shape.
